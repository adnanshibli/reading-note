### Tables
Define an HTML Table
The <table> tag defines an HTML table.

Each table row is defined with a <tr> tag. Each table header is defined with a <th> tag. Each table data/cell is defined with a <td> tag.

By default, the text in <th> elements are bold and centered.

By default, the text in <td> elements are regular and left-aligned.

You may also need entries in
a table to stretch down across
more than one row.
The rowspan attribute can be
used on a <th> or <td> element
to indicate how many rows a cell
should span down the table.
In the example on the left you
can see that ABC is showing a
movie from 6pm - 8pm, whereas
the BBC and CNN channels are
both showing two programs
during this time period (each of
which lasts one hour).
If you look at the last <tr>
element, it only contains three
elements even though there are
four columns in the result below.
This is because the movie in the
<tr> element above it uses the
rowspan attribute to stretch
down and take over the cell
below.

Some of the HTML editors that
come in content management
systems offer tools to help
draw tables. If the first row of
your table only contains <th>
elements then you may find that
the editor inserts a <thead>
element automatically
Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred
to a printed document that contains
spaces for you to fill in information.
HTML borrows the concept of a form to refer to different
elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to
your site.
Whether you are adding a simple search box to your website or
you need to create more complicated insurance applications,
HTML forms give you a set of elements to collect data from
your users. In this chapter you will learn:
● How to create a form on your website
● The different tools for collecting data
● New HTML5 form controls

CREATING OBJECTS USING
CONSTRUCTOR SYNTAX 
bject Types (Blueprints) (Classes)
The examples from the previous chapters are limited. They only create single objects.

Sometimes we need a "blueprint" for creating many objects of the same "type".

The way to create an "object type", is to use an object constructor function.

In the example above, function Person() is an object constructor function.

Objects of the same type are created by calling the constructor function with the new keyword:
