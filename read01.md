# introduction for HTML and Javascript
### structure
In the browser window you can see a web page that features exactly
the same content . To
describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want
to appear on the page.
You can see the HTML code for this page below. Don't worry about what
the code means yet. We start to look at it in more detail on the next
page.
The HTML code (in blue) is made up of characters that live inside angled
brackets — these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually
made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag
has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser
something about the information that sits between its opening and
closing tags.

You met the <body> element
in the first example we created.
Everything inside this element is
shown inside the main browser
window.
<head>
Before the <body> element you
will often see a <head> element.
This contains information
about the page (rather than
information that is shown within
the main part of the browser
window that is highlighted in
blue on the opposite page).
You will usually find a <title>
element inside the <head>
element.
<title>
The contents of the <title>
element are either shown in the
top of the browser, above where
you usually type in the URL of
the page you want to visit, or
on the tab for that page (if your
browser uses tabs to allow you
to view multiple pages at the
same time)

**layout**
***Page Layout Information:***


Header: The part of a front end which is used at the top of the page. <header> tag is used to add header section in web pages.
Navigation bar: The navigation bar is same as menu list. It is used to display the content information using hyperlink.
Index / Sidebar: It holds additional information or advertisements and is not always necessary to be added into the page.
Content Section: The content section is the main part where content is displayed.
Footer: The footer section contains the contact information and other query related to web pages. The footer section always put on the bottom of the web pages. The <footer> tag is used to set the footer in web pages.

### procces and design
***Who is the Site For?***
Every website should be designed for the
target audience—not just for yourself or the
site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is.
Target Audience: individuals
*  What is the age range of your target audience?
* Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?
* Which country do your visitors live in?
* Do they live in urban or rural areas?


# javascript
Before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript
language itself, you need to become familiar with some key
concepts in computer programming. They will be covered in
three sections: 
**A** 
What is a script and how do I create one?
**B**
How do computers fit in with the world around them? 
**C**
How do I write a script for a web page?
--------------------
Once you have learned the basics, the following chapters will show how the JavaScript
language can be used to tell browsers what you want them to do.
To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it.
Humans can achieve complex goals without thinking
about them too much, for example you might be
able to drive a car, cook breakfast, or send an email
without a set of detailed instructions. But the first
time we do these things they can seem daunting.
Therefore, when learning a new skill, we often break
it down into smaller tasks, and learn one of these at
a time. With experience these individual tasks grow
familiar and seem simpler.
Some of the scripts you will be reading or writing
when you have finished this book will be quite
complicated and might look intimidating at
first. However, a script is just a series of short
instructions, each of which is performed in order
to solve the problem in hand. This is why creating a
script is like writing a recipe or manual that allows a
computer to solve a puzzle one step at a time.
It is worth noting, however, that a computer doesn't
learn how to perform tasks like you or I might; it
needs to follow instructions every time it performs
the task. So a program must give the computer
enough detail to perform the task as if every time
were its first time.
