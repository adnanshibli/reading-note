## css
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern 
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule 
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.
X Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).
X Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
